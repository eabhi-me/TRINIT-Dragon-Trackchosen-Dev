<h2 id="problem-statement">Problem statement: Test Formatter </h2>
Idea: A site where students can upload pdf of question papers of exams such as 
JEE and get an online mock for the same question paper. It can also be used by 
different institutes to conduct online assessments. 
Resource: Tool to perform Optical Character Recognition(OCR) with API https://ocr.space. 
<h3>Features:</h3>

1. Test Generator: Users can upload a PDF/Image and get an online mock 
assessment(text only) of the same with an option to upload an image for 
each question.
2. Answer Key: The user can upload the PDF/Image of the answer key along 
with the question paper and get their attempt corrected automatically. 
3. Timer: Add a timer so that the user can track the remaining time while 
attempting the mock. 
4. Tool: Users can directly make a manual online assessment(text and 
image) without needing a PDF. 
5. Social Space: Users can make their test public and different users can 
attempt and discuss it. 
6. Test Review: Create an interface to review and finalize the test before 
making it public. 
7. Analytical Side: Analysis of the attempt with different fields of information 
such as time spent on a question and on a subject(Physics, Chemistry, 
Maths), Time wasted on a question, total score, negatives, comparison 
with peers, etc 
Brownie Points: 
1. Image Extraction: Automatic image extraction from the pdf and correct 
alignment with the associated question. 
2. Personal Space: Users can add friends and form groups with them.
3. Wider support: Support for different formats not limited to just JEE exam. 
4. Ratings: Allow people to upvote a public test to distinguish between the 
good and bad tests uploaded.
